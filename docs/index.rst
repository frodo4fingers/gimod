   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to GIMod's documentation!
=================================

GIMod stands for **G**\ raphical **I**\ nterface for basic **Mod**\ el creation. It is intended to make the creation of your basic model with/for GIMLi easier. The result is a poly (.poly) or mesh (.bms) which can be further used in your own script. GIMod is written and tested with python 3.6.0, matplotlib 2.0.0 and Qt5.
