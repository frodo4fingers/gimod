# GIMod
**G**raphical **I**nterface for basic **Mod**el creation

GIMod is intended to make the creation of your basic model with/for [GIMLi](www.pygimli.org) easier. The result is a poly or mesh which can be further used in your own script.

---
## you need
+ [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (written and tested with python 3.5.2)
+ [GIMLi](http://www.pygimli.org/installation.html)
+ [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/downloads.html)

## handling
So far it is only possible to start with a sketch/ a picture (png, jpg, etc.) and handle the threshold for a black and white image. The result is the dotted shape of your image. You can adjust the number of polygons found within the shape and adjust the point density (the lower, the denser.. need to fix that)
