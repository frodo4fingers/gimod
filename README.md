# GIMod
**G**raphical **I**nterface for basic **Mod**el creation

GIMod is intended to make the creation of your basic model with/for [GIMLi](www.pygimli.org) easier. The result is a poly (.poly) or mesh (.bms) which can be further used in your own script.
(written and tested with python 3.6.0 and matplotlib 2.0.0)

---
## requirements:
+ [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
+ [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download/)
+ [GIMLi](http://www.pygimli.org/installation.html)
+ [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/downloads.html)
+ [Shapely](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely)

## handling
The GUI is parted in to two areas. On the left side there is a tree view of all polygons which are displayed on the right. The toolbar above those inherits the main tools from [GIMLi](www.pygimli.org)s *polytools* to create your polygon.

## TODOs
There are a lot. GIMod still is buggy at a few lines and i am on to that. To see where the problems are, see the to.do file which was generated with [TODO-show](https://github.com/IanMitchell/atom-todo-show) or test at free will and feel free to [open a ticket](https://github.com/frodo4fingers/gimod/issues). For further reading i will set up a [wiki](https://github.com/frodo4fingers/gimod/wiki).
