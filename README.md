# GIMod
GIMod stands for **G**raphical **I**nterface for basic **Mod**el creation. It is intended to make the creation of your basic model with/for GIMLi easier. The result is a poly (.poly) or mesh (.bms) which can be further used in your own script. GIMod is written and tested with python 3.6.0, matplotlib 2.0.0 and Qt5.
